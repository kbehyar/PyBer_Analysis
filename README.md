# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

Purpose of this analysis is to compare the total weekly fares gained between different city types using PyBer, a ride-sharing service. We will be creating Dataframes and visualizations to show this comparison. This analysis will present the CEO with recommendations to address any disparities among the city types.

### Results

Based on the results shown in the image below, Urban cities, due to their larger and condensed population, have a much higher number of rides requested which also explains the large number of drivers available in them and overall total fares gained.

Rural cities tend to have a larger average fare per ride due to longer distances travelled which also explains the average fare per driver being much higher than Suburban and Urban cities. Rural cities tend to be built more further apart requiring longer distances traveled.
